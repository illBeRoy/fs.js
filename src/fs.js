/*
    The file concludes of two classes:
        1. The FS module - which provides the interface
        2. The FSO class - which provides an instanceable class for user input\output operations

    Few notes:
        1. You can have as many FSOs as you wish.
        2. Unless you're adding modifications of your own, there's no real reason to directly use the FS module.
