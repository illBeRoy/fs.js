    // All files are contained within localStorage keys matching their location. Meaning, should there be a file in .\dir\file.txt,
    // its key would be "fsjs.\dir\file.txt".

    // Within that given key would be the contents of the file:
    {
        "type" : "raw \ base64", // Type of the file - defined if it's stored as raw text or a base64 encoded string
        "data" : "" // A string containing the file's data. Should it be binary, data is required to be encoded using BASE64 before
    },

    // An example text file containing a string would be:
    {
        "type" : "raw",
        "data" : "Hello, world!"
    }

    // NOTE: fsjs does NOT encode binary data into BASE64 for compatability purposes. In order to encode your files, you are required
    // to use external libraries.

    // That is all, cheers!
